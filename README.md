# Final Project
## Part 2: A tribute to Clustering
### Georgios Zavlanis 09-02-2025

In this second part of the final project, I made a tribute to Clustering methods. I applied 3 famous clustering methods to the dataset and record the results.

Conclusions of the procedures are shown in the form of diagrams in the Plots folder and in printouts in the terminal. The printouts are also stored inside the report.txt file,
inside Reports folder.

In order to run the project run in terminal:

```aiexclude
pip install requirements.txt
```
